# NexusHub v2.0.0 — Development Plan

A 12-phase roadmap from scaffolding to GA. Check boxes as work lands on `dev`.
Phases are sequential in priority but work can overlap where dependencies allow.

## Phase 3 — Auth, sessions, RBAC

- [ ] Argon2id password hashing helper
- [ ] JWT access token + rotating refresh token flow
- [ ] Login, logout, refresh, password change endpoints
- [ ] Roles: `admin`, `operator`, `viewer`
- [ ] Middleware: `RequireAuth`, `RequireRole`
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Audit-log entries for auth events
- [ ] Optional: TOTP second factor
- [ ] Optional: SSO/OIDC hook point (not implemented, just planned)

---

## Phase 4 — WireGuard core

- [ ] Abstraction layer over `wgctrl-go` for interface and peer CRUD
- [ ] Key pair generation (server + per-peer), pre-shared key rotation
- [ ] Peer config export (plain text + QR code PNG)
- [ ] Allowed-IPs validation & IP pool management
- [ ] DNS push options per peer
- [ ] Endpoint handling behind NAT
- [ ] Kernel vs. `boringtun` userspace mode detection
- [ ] Startup: reconcile DB state with live kernel state

---

## Phase 5 — eBPF security rules

- [ ] Pick loader: `cilium/ebpf` (Go) vs. libbpf + CO-RE
- [ ] Rule model: per-peer allow/deny lists, L3/L4 filters, rate limits
- [ ] Example programs: peer ingress filter, bandwidth meter, connection counter
- [ ] Userspace map management (add/remove/update rule entries live)
- [ ] Metrics export (maps → Prometheus)
- [ ] Safety: verifier-friendly patterns, bounds checks, no unbounded loops
- [ ] Loader tests in a kernel-ready CI runner
- [ ] Fallback path if kernel lacks BTF or required features

---

## Phase 6 — Backend HTTP API (v1)

- [ ] Router: `chi` or `gin` (decide & document)
- [ ] Structured logging via `slog`
- [ ] Request ID + correlation ID middleware
- [ ] Standardized error envelope + problem+json
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.1 spec under `docs/api/`
- [ ] Endpoints: peers, interfaces, rules, users, audit log, health, metrics
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, sorting conventions
- [ ] Server-Sent Events or WebSocket for live peer/rule state
- [ ] Graceful shutdown

---

## Phase 7 — Frontend application

- [ ] App shell with Refine + routing
- [ ] Auth flow wired to backend (login, refresh, logout)
- [ ] Peers list, peer detail, peer create/edit (with QR download)
- [ ] Interfaces list & detail
- [ ] eBPF rules editor
- [ ] Users & roles admin screen
- [ ] Audit log viewer with filtering

---

## Phase 8 — CLI (`nexushub`)

- [ ] Commands: `login`, `peer`, `interface`, `rule`, `user`, `export`, `import`, `doctor`
- [ ] Config file at `~/.config/nexushub/config.yaml`
- [ ] API key auth for unattended use
- [ ] Shell completion generation (bash, zsh, fish)
- [ ] Packaging: `goreleaser` config for binaries + `.deb`/`.rpm`

---

## Phase 9 — Testing

- [ ] Backend unit tests (services, handlers with real DB)
- [ ] Backend integration tests (full HTTP + DB)
- [ ] Frontend unit tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
- [ ] Frontend MSW-backed component tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright) covering: login, peer create, rule attach, audit view
- [ ] eBPF tests in a kernel runner
- [ ] Load test baseline (k6 or vegeta) — document expected RPS and latency targets
- [ ] Coverage gate in CI (threshold TBD)

---

## Phase 10 — Observability

- [ ] Prometheus metrics: HTTP, DB pool, WireGuard peer stats, eBPF counters
- [ ] `/metrics` endpoint + sample Grafana dashboards in `docs/deployment/`
- [ ] OpenTelemetry traces for HTTP + DB
- [ ] Structured audit log with retention policy
- [ ] Alert examples: auth spikes, peer handshake failures, eBPF load errors

---

## Phase 11 — Packaging & deployment

- [ ] Multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`) image published to `ghcr.io/tomeksdev/wireguard-install-with-gui`
- [ ] Systemd unit files for bare-metal installs

- [ ] Documented backup/restore procedure

---

## Phase 12 — Docs, release, launch

- [ ] User guide: install, first peer, eBPF rules, backup (`docs/user-guide/`)
- [ ] API reference generated from OpenAPI (`docs/api/`)
- [ ] Deployment guide: Docker, bare-metal, k8s (`docs/deployment/`)
- [ ] Screenshots for README (`docs/assets/screenshots/`)
- [ ] Migration guide from v1.0.0 Python WebGUI
- [ ] Changelog via release-please
- [ ] `v2.0.0` tag → docker-publish workflow pushes images
